This project analyzes Rockbuster Stealth LLC’s film rental data to help the company transition to an online streaming model in response to industry competition. Using PostgreSQL and SQL, I answered key business questions around revenue, customer location, and rental behavior, then visualized the insights to support strategic decision-making.
Rockbuster Stealth Online Launch Strategy – SQL Analysis Project
Project Overview
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a global movie rental company planning to pivot from physical store locations to an online streaming platform to stay competitive with services like Netflix and Amazon Prime. As a data analyst on the Business Intelligence (BI) team, I was tasked with loading Rockbuster's historical data into a PostgreSQL database and using SQL to analyze key metrics that would inform the company's 2020 launch strategy.

This project focuses on answering critical business questions related to revenue, customer demographics, and regional sales trends to help shape Rockbuster’s online growth strategy. The results were visualized and compiled into stakeholder-ready insights to support data-driven decision-making.

Key Business Questions Answered
Which movies generated the highest and lowest revenue?

What is the average rental duration across the inventory?

Where are Rockbuster’s customers located?

Which customers have the highest lifetime value and where are they based?

Do sales performance and rental trends differ by geographic region?

This work helped inform the company’s pivot to online streaming and demonstrated how SQL and relational databases can be used to drive business decisions.
